# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis.

#### The purpose of this election audit analysis is to obtain a data set, no matter where it is from and run the python script so that we can analyze the data to see the breakdown of county and candidate total votes and percentage of total votes. It also displays the winer as well.

##  Election-Audit Results: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

### How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
###    Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
###   Which county had the largest number of votes?
###    Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
###    Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?

##  Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
